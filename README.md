# Hate Speech Classifier

This project used a labeled dataset from [CrowdFlower's free repository](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/) which classified tweets as either not offensive, offensive but not containing hate speech, or containing hate speech. It consists of a notebook showing my process and an app hosted on AWS that can use to classify single tweets. Click here to access the app.
