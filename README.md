# Hate Speech Classifier

This project used a labeled dataset from [CrowdFlower's free repository](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/) which classified tweets as either not offensive, offensive but not containing hate speech, or containing hate speech. It consists of a notebook showing my process and an [app](http://gordon.pythonanywhere.com/) that can use to classify single tweets. I also write a [blog post](http://gfleetwood.github.io/hate-speech/).
