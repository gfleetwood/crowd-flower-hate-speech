      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>My name is Gordon and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist. This project is perhaps my secong serious foray into Natural Language Processing. The data consists of tweet labeled to be not offensive, offensive but without hate speech, and containing hate speech. It was acquired from a <a href="https://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone/">free repository</a> provided by CrowdFlower, a company which provides an online workforce for labeling and validating data. The model behind the app is scikit-learn's Random Forest Classifier. There's a lot of room for optimization which I hope to do in the near future. Here is a <a href="url">link</a> to the code for the app and a Jupyter notebook on my process. I also wrote a <a href="url">blog</a> on the project as well.
